# Sticky sessions with proxy

Simple and customizable way to use multicore features with [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express).

## How it works

Launches multiple worker processes through [cluster](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html), using bunch of ports.
One worker process becomes also 'http-proxy', serving as sticky session balancer.

Establishes sticky round-robin balancer for any kind of http frameworks. Not only, but including socket.io and express. 
Client will always connect to same worker process sticked with customizable hash function.
For example, socket.io multi-stage authorization will work as expected. 

## Installation

```bash
npm install sticky-socket-cluster
```


## Basic Usage

```javascript
require('sticky-socket-cluster')(start);

function start(port) {
	require('http').createServer(function(req, res) {
	  		res.end('worker: ' + port);
		}).listen(port, function() {
	  	console.log('server started on ' + port + ' port');
	});
}
```

## Customized Usage

(Complete demo in [test](test) folder)

```javascript
require('sticky-socket-cluster/replace-console')();
	// prefixes console output with worker ids.

var options = {
	workers: 2, // total workers (default: cpu cores count).
	first_port: 8000, // 8000, 8001 are worker's ports (default: 8000).
	proxy_port: 5000, // default (5000).
	session_hash: function (req, res) { return req.connection.remoteAddress; },
		// can use cookie-based session ids and etc. (default: int31 hash).
		
	no_sockets: false // allow socket.io proxy (default: false).
};

require('sticky-socket-cluster')(options, start);

function start(port) {
	var express = require('express');
	var http = require('http');
	var app = express();
	var server = http.Server(app);
	var io = require('socket.io')(server);
	
	io.on('connection', function(socket)
	{
		console.log("socket.io connection handler...");
		//...
	});

	server.listen(port, function() {
		console.log('Express and socket.io listening on port ' + port);
	});
}
```
